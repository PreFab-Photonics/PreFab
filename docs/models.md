# PreFab Models

Each photonic foundry requires its own *predictor* and *corrector* models. These models are updated regularly based on data from recent fabrication runs. The following models are currently available:

| Foundry | Process | Version | Dataset | Type | Full Name | Status | Usage |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---- | --------- |------- | ----- |
| ANT | NanoSOI | v5 (Jun 3 2023) | v4 (Apr 12 2023) | Predictor | p_ANT_NanoSOI_v5_d4 | Beta | Open |
| ANT | NanoSOI | v5 (Jun 3 2023) | v4 (Apr 12 2023) | Corrector | c_ANT_NanoSOI_v5_d4 | Beta | Open |

*This list will update over time. Usage is subject to change. Please contact us or create an issue if you would like to see a new foundry and process modelled.*
