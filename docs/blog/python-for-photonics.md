While it is still under active development and may have limited functionality and operating system support, Zed aims to provide a sleek and efficient environment for developers. Its emphasis on speed and minimalism could make it a strong contender as it matures. We recommend keeping a close eye on this IDE as it evolves.

For the rest of this guide, we will use VS Code (and therefore Cursor).

### Essential VS Code Extensions for Python Development

To further enhance your development experience in VS Code (or Cursor), add these essential extensions (see below for how to install them):

- **[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)**: The Python extension for VS Code provides rich support for the Python language, including features like IntelliSense, linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, and testing. It is maintained by Microsoft and is one of the most installed extensions for Python development.

- **[Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)**: The Jupyter extension for VS Code allows you to work with Jupyter Notebooks directly within VS Code, offering an interactive environment for data analysis, visualization, and computational experimentation. We love Jupyter for rapidly prototyping and exploring new ideas, and this extension makes working with them in VS Code a pleasure.

- **[Ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)**: The Ruff extension for VS Code is a fast, highly configurable linter (code quality check) and formatter for Python, designed to help you maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards. It is so fast that it can run in the background while you code, and it will notify you of any issues in your code as you save your file (which we will configure later in this guide). We also love Ruff because it is opinionated and enforces a consistent style guide, which can help you focus on what really matters and not waste precious development time on style choices.

- **[GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)**: The GitHub Theme (Dark) for VS Code is a visually appealing theme that enhances the appearance of your editor, making it easier on the eyes (especially in the evening) and more enjoyable to work with. Even if you don't like this theme, we think it's a good idea to browse the marketplace and find a theme that you do like, making for a more pleasant coding experience under long hours of work.

    Now, with just a click of the save button, Ruff will automatically enhance the appearance and readability of your code.

**Configure Jupyter Startup Commands**:

- These commands ensure that your notebook automatically reloads modules before executing code, which is helpful during development. This one has saved us many headaches in the early days of working with Python.
- Add the following setting to your `settings.json` file:

  ```json
  "jupyter.runStartupCommands": [
    "%load_ext autoreload",
    "%autoreload 2"
  ],
  ```

**Accessing the `settings.json` File**:

- To open the `settings.json` file in VS Code:
  - Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or press `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+,` on macOS).
  - In the Settings page, click on the **Open Settings (JSON)** icon (a document with a small arrow) in the upper-right corner. This will open the `settings.json` file where you can edit your settings directly.
  - Alternatively, you can use the Command Palette:
    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
    - Type `**Open User Settings (JSON)**` and select it from the list.

**Example `settings.json` Entries**:

Replace or update your `settings.json` with the following entries:

```json

    "editor": {
        "formatOnSave": true,
        "codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll": "explicit",
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
        },
        "defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"
    },
    "notebook": {
        "formatOnSave": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "codeActionsOnSave": {
            "notebook.source.fixAll": true,
            "notebook.source.organizeImports": true
        },
        "defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"
    },
    "jupyter.runStartupCommands": [
        "%load_ext autoreload",
        "%autoreload 2"
    ],
}
```

!!! tip "Thought"
    Customizing your IDE to suit your workflow—including setting up keyboard shortcuts that work best for you—can significantly improve your productivity and make your coding experience more enjoyable.

## Setting Up Your Python Virtual Environment

Creating a Python virtual environment is essential for managing dependencies and ensuring a clean development setup. It allows you to isolate your project's packages and Python version from other projects and the system-wide Python installation.

> We think it's a good idea to use a virtual environment manager to keep your global Python installation clean and to avoid conflicts between different projects.

Here are three popular options for managing virtual environments:

- **[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)**: Conda is a cross-platform package and environment manager that can handle both Python and non-Python dependencies, making it ideal for complex projects in scientific computing and data science. It supports creating isolated environments and includes its own package repositories.

- **[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)**: The venv module is the built-in tool for creating virtual environments in Python 3. It's simple to use and comes pre-installed with Python, making it a convenient choice for managing environments with different packages or Python versions.

- **[uv](https://astral.sh/uv/)**: uv is a high-performance virtual environment manager created by Astral (the creators of Ruff). It offers rapid environment creation and management, aiming to be a minimalistic and efficient alternative to existing tools. Although still in its early stages, uv is designed to push the boundaries of performance and development ergonomics. We get inspired just by using it, and we think you will too.

For the rest of this tutorial, we will use Conda due to its popularity and robust feature set.

### Setting Up Conda

To set up a Python virtual environment using Conda, follow these steps:

**1. Install Conda**

If you don't have Conda installed, you can install either Anaconda or Miniconda. Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda that includes only Conda and its dependencies.

- **Download Miniconda** from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) suitable for your operating system.

- **Install Miniconda** by running the installer and following the on-screen instructions.

**2. Create a New Environment**

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by going to `View` > `Terminal` (or pressing `` Ctrl+` `` on Windows/Linux or `` Cmd+` `` on macOS). Use the following command to create a new Conda environment. Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.11` with the Python version you need.

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11
```

**3. Activate the Environment**

Activate your new environment with the following command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

**4. Install Necessary Packages**

You can now install any packages you need using Conda or `pip`. For example, to install NumPy and SciPy, use:

```bash
conda install numpy scipy
```

Or, to install a package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install prefab
```

### Selecting the Conda Environment in VS Code

After setting up your Conda environment, you'll want to ensure that VS Code uses this environment for running and debugging your Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.

#### Choosing the Python Interpreter

**1. Open a Python File**:

- Open any Python file in VS Code or create a new one with the `.py` extension.

**2. Select the Interpreter**:

- Click on the Python version displayed in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code status bar. It might say something like `Python 3.x.x`.

- A list of available Python interpreters will appear. Look for your Conda environment in the list. It should be listed with the name you gave it (e.g., `myenv`) and the path to the Python executable.

- Select your Conda environment from the list.

**3. Verify the Interpreter**:

- Once selected, the status bar should update to reflect the interpreter from your Conda environment.

#### Choosing the Jupyter Kernel

When working with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code, you need to select the appropriate kernel associated with your Conda environment.

**1. Open a Jupyter Notebook**:

- Open an existing `.ipynb` file or create a new one in VS Code.

**2. Select the Kernel**:

- At the top-right corner of the notebook editor, you will see the kernel name (e.g., `Python 3`). Click on it to change the kernel.

- In the kernel selection dialog, you should see a list of available kernels. Your Conda environment should be listed, often with the name of the environment and the Python version.

- Select the kernel corresponding to your Conda environment.

**3. Verify the Kernel**:

- The kernel name should update to reflect the selected Conda environment.

**Troubleshooting**:

If your Conda environment's kernel doesn't appear in the list, you may need to install the `ipykernel` package in your environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv  # or the name of your environment
conda install ipykernel
```

Alternatively, you can register the environment's kernel manually:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
```

After installing the kernel, restart VS Code, and it should recognize the new kernel associated with your Conda environment.

By selecting the correct Python interpreter and Jupyter kernel, you ensure that your code runs in the intended environment, using the packages and dependencies you've installed.

    And that's it! The rest of this guide will focus on additional tools and resources that can help you take your Python-based photonics development to the next level.

## Leveraging Cloud and Remote Tools for Computational Resources

Photonics simulations and computations can be resource-intensive, often requiring significant computational power and specialized hardware. Leveraging cloud and remote tools allows you to access powerful computational resources without the need for expensive local hardware. Here are some platforms and tools that can help you take advantage of cloud computing:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free cloud service (with some paid options) provided by Google that enables you to write and execute Python code through a web browser. It offers free access to GPUs and TPUs, allowing you to accelerate your simulations and computations using powerful hardware.

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provides a full-fledged cloud-based development environment directly within GitHub. It allows you to develop in the cloud using a cloud-hosted VS Code environment that's configured for your project.

- [Modal](https://modal.com/) is a platform that allows you to run your code in the cloud with minimal setup. It provides serverless computing, enabling you to run functions and scripts without managing servers. We love Modal for how easy it is to leverage powerful compute without having to leave the local Python environment.

- [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/) provides cloud GPU workstations and servers for deep learning and computational tasks. They offer powerful NVIDIA GPUs (though sometimes limited based on usage) and pre-configured environments with popular frameworks, saving setup time.

- [SSH VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) allows you to develop remotely by connecting to remote servers in your organization or cloud instances (e.g., AWS, GCP, Lambda Labs) directly from your local VS Code editor.

## Terminal Tools

In addition to a good IDE, having the right terminal tools can offer nice benefits. Here are some useful command-line tools you may want to install:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project. It's an indispensable tool for any developer, and we think it is an underrated tool for photonics development too. Although VS Code has a built-in Git client, using Git in the terminal can be more flexible. We recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Q31YkorUE) for a quick introduction on using Git.

- [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop) is an interactive process viewer for Linux and macOS systems. It provides a real-time view of system processes, CPU, and memory usage, making it especially easy to monitor remote compute instances.

- [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) is like `htop` for NVIDIA GPUs. There are also many other `top`-like tools out there, so pick the one that best fits your system and workflow.

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is a popular shell framework that enhances the capabilities of the Zsh shell (which we also recommend using). It provides a rich set of plugins that make using the terminal much more powerful. If you find yourself using the terminal even just a little bit, this is a great tool to have.

## AI Coding Assistants

AI-powered coding assistants have become invaluable tools for developers, whether you're just starting with Python or exploring new concepts in any field. These assistants offer real-time help, explanations, and code suggestions, making them excellent learning aids and productivity boosters.

- **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is *the* widely recognized (large) language model. They make improvements to their models and user interface regularly, so we recommend staying updated with its latest features to ensure you're utilizing the most advanced tools available.

- **[Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/)**: Claude, developed by Anthropic, is a competitor to ChatGPT. While benchmarking language models can be challenging (many believe Claude offers superior capabilities at least in some contexts), using multiple models from different providers (there are many others!) can help you obtain the best possible answers.

- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)**: As previously mentioned, Cursor is an AI-enhanced IDE based on VS Code. One of its unique features is the ability to choose from multiple language models, helping you get the most accurate and helpful responses at any given time.

- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**: GitHub Copilot integrates seamlessly into VS Code, providing AI-assisted code completion and suggestions. While we believe Cursor offers superior features as an AI coding assistant, Copilot is a strong option if you prefer VS Code as your IDE.

There has been considerable discussion surrounding AI assistants, with both positive and negative viewpoints. However, when used pragmatically, these tools can [enhance productivity](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/). If you're not already using these tools, we strongly encourage you to consider doing so.

## Other Resources

While AI coding assistants are a great starting point when you need help with code, there are numerous online communities and resources available to assist with more specialized problems that other developers may have already solved. Engaging with these communities can provide valuable insights and support.
