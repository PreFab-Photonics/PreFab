# PreFab

PreFab leverages **deep learning** to model fabrication-induced structural variations in integrated photonic devices. Through this _virtual nanofabrication environment_, we uncover valuable insights into nanofabrication processes and enhance device design accuracy.

## Prediction

PreFab accurately predicts process-induced structural alterations such as corner rounding, washing away of small lines and islands, and filling of narrow holes in planar photonic devices. This enables designers to quickly prototype expected performance and rectify designs prior to nanofabrication.

## Correction

PreFab automates corrections to device designs, ensuring the fabricated outcome aligns with the original design. This results in reduced structural variation and performance disparity from simulation to experiment.

## Models

PreFab accommodates unique _predictor_ and _corrector_ models for each photonic foundry, regularly updated based on recent fabrication data. Current models include (see full list on [`docs/models.md`](https://github.com/PreFab-Photonics/PreFab/blob/main/docs/models.md)):

| Foundry | Process | Latest Version    | Latest Dataset   | Model Name  |
| ------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| ANT     | NanoSOI | ANF1 (May 6 2024) | d10 (Jun 8 2024) | ANT_NanoSOI_ANF1_d10 |
| ANT     | SiN     | ANF1 (May 6 2024) | d1 (Jan 31 2024) | ANT_SiN_ANF1_d1 |
| Generic | DUV-SOI | ANF1 (May 6 2024) | d0 (Jul 30 2024) | generic_DUV_SOI_ANF1_d0 |

> _New models and foundries are to be regularly added. Usage may change. For additional foundry and process models, feel free to contact us._

## Installation

Install PreFab via pip:

```sh
pip install prefab
```

Or clone the repository and install in development mode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PreFab-Photonics/PreFab.git
cd PreFab
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

### Account setup

Before you can make PreFab requests, you will need to [create an account](https://www.prefabphotonics.com/login).

To link your account, you will need a token. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal. This will open a browser window where you can log in and authenticate your token.

```sh
python3 -m prefab setup
```

### Guides

Visit [`/docs/examples`](https://github.com/PreFab-Photonics/PreFab/tree/main/docs/examples) or our [docs](https://docs.prefabphotonics.com/) to get started with your first predictions.

## Performance and Usage

PreFab models are served via a serverless cloud platform. Please note:

- üê¢ CPU inference may result in slower performance. Future updates will introduce GPU inference.
- ü•∂ The first prediction may take longer due to cold start server loading. Subsequent predictions will be faster.
- üòä Be considerate of usage. Start small and limit usage during the initial stages. Thank you!
